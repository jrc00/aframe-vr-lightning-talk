## Why
* VR is awesome!
* WebGL is standard, powerful, but complex and difficult to learn.
* Making VR accessible to millions of exisiting web developers.
*

## What
An [open source](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) library for creating virtual reality experiences inside the browser with ONE line of code:

` <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js"></script>`

This allows you to create WebVR websites with basic HTML.

Created by Mozilla.
Can be used with Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, desktops and smartphones.

*

## How
A-Frame comes with a collection of building blocks for models, videos, skies,
geometries, and more. Also included are controls, animations, and cursors,
making it easy for developers to begin building rich interactive VR websites.
A-Frame launches with a number of templates to give web developers easy starting
oints, and Mozilla is encouraging healthy sharing of template derivatives in the
opes of accelerating the creation of WebVR websites.
